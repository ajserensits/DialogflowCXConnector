# DialogflowCXConnector
A base application that shows how to connect a voice call to Dialogflow CX while leveraging the Avaya Cloud Inbound XML APIs.  The connector also handles SMS interactions and maintains a session.

Refer to instructions.txt to get started.

NOTE: The Sms integration is not intended for production as I would suggest swapping out the in memory array with a database table
